# Dice-Roll-Application Project README


## Overview

This repo contains my work from the week 4 project from the
[Developing Data Products][1] class from Johns Hopkins University within the
[Data Science Specialization][2] on Coursera. The original instructions for the
project can be found beneath the brief description section below. The script was
created in RStudio.

## Brief Description

The original instructions for this assignment are shown below. We were free to
choose our own topic, and I decided to make a simple game based on the rolling
of two dice. The repo contains the application script and a folder of the dice
images used as output. The script uses the `shiny` package to build and run the
package. The project required two deliverables - one of which is the
application. The second deliverable is a presentation pitching the merits of the
app, and that presentation will go in a different repo.

>## Peer-graded Assignment: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch
>
>This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a `Shiny`
application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use `Slidify`
or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your
application.
>
>### Your Shiny Application
>
>Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The
documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started
using your application. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server. Share
the application link by pasting it into the provided text box. Share your
`server.R` and `ui.R` code on github. The application must include the
following:
>
>* Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
>* Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
>* Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
>* You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use
your application.
>* The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an
external link.
>
>The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you.
